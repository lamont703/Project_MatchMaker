    const validationResult = await validateVideo(file);
    if (!validationResult.valid) {
      throw new Error(validationResult.error);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Optional client-side compression
    const compressedFile = await compressVideo(file, {
      maxSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024, // 50MB

      maxDuration: 30
    });
    
    // Step 3: Generate upload URL from backend
    const uploadUrl = await generateUploadUrl();
    
    // Step 4: Direct upload to Azure Blob Storage
    const uploadResult = await uploadToBlob(compressedFile, uploadUrl, {
      onProgress: (progress) => updateProgressBar(progress),
      onError: (error) => handleUploadError(error)
    });
    
    // Step 5: Trigger server-side processing
    await triggerProcessingPipeline(uploadResult.blobUrl);
    
    return { success: true, videoId: uploadResult.videoId };
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Video upload failed:', error);
    return { success: false, error: error.message };

    event.respondWith(
      caches.open('video-cache-v1').then(async (cache) => {
        const cachedResponse = await cache.match(event.request);
        
        if (cachedResponse) {
          // Return cached video
          return cachedResponse;
        }
        
        // Fetch and cache new video
        const networkResponse = await fetch(event.request);
        if (networkResponse.ok) {
          cache.put(event.request, networkResponse.clone());
        }
        
        return networkResponse;
      })
    );
  }
});

// Background sync for failed uploads
self.addEventListener('sync', (event) => {
  if (event.tag === 'video-upload') {
    event.waitUntil(retryFailedUploads());
  }
});
